This script, was written by raz0 at http://phpfm.zalon.dk.  At this time, 

he, nor http://phpfm.zalon.dk, is no longer officially supporting the 

script or providing updates. Consequently, we have obtained permission to 

redistribute the script with a new graphics package as well as a handful 

of minor code updates.  


Regarding support, please read the following discussion forum thread:

http://phpfm.zalon.dk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=64

Please note that the original developer, as well as GateQuest, has not

placed a high priority on supporting PHPFM.  We are confident, however,

that given the amount of time PHPFM's current version has been stable

coupled with the sheer amount of domains it has been successfully 

deployed upon, that if you follow the installation procedures in detail

and make certain your web host passes all of the requirements documented

in requirements.txt, support should be rare.  If you would like to 

request a feature, please do so here:

http://phpfm.zalon.dk/forum/viewforum.php?f=3  

To reiterate, all feature requests and are considered but are not a lock 

to be implemented.


Thank you for your understanding.

GateQuest, Inc.
